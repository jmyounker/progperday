# Program a Day

I'm trying to write one coherent program a day for a month.  The goal
is to improve my ability to complete tasks on a regular schedule, and
to not waste too much time while performing them.

**20150224** + Roughly translate an XML resume into RTF.

**20150225** + Too to translate timestamps into dates and vice versa.

**20150226** - Fucked this one up.

**20150227** + Got back on the horse. Implementation of random contraction algorithm
           for graphs.

**20150228** + Lexer for a simple lisp-like calculator language.
