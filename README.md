# Program a Day

I'm trying to write one coherent program a day for a month.  The goal
is to improve my ability to complete tasks on a regular schedule, and
to not waste too much time while performing them.

**20150224** + Roughly translate an XML resume into RTF.

**20150225** + Too to translate timestamps into dates and vice versa.

**20150226** - Fucked this one up.

**20150227** + Got back on the horse. Implementation of random contraction algorithm
           for graphs.

**20150228** + Lexer for a simple lisp-like calculator language.

**20150301** + Parser for a simple lisp-like calculator language.

**20150302** - Fucked this one up.

**20150303** - LLVM compiler for a simple lisp-like calculator language.

**20150304** - Fucked this one up.

**20150305** - Fucked this one up.

**20150306** - Fibonacci function in LLVM IR.

**20150307** - Count adjectives in a text.

**20150308** - Simple genetic algorithm.

**20150309** - I am so tired.  I am **so** phoning it in today with a random exchange sort.

**20150310** - A python implementation of the infamous sleep sort.

**20150311** - Futile evening hacking on something that's not done yet. Prog explains failure.

**20150312** - Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. (Crappy implementation.)
