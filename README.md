# Program a Day

I'm trying to write one coherent program a day for a month.  The goal
is to improve my ability to complete tasks on a regular schedule, and
to not waste too much time while performing them.

**20150224** + Roughly translate an XML resume into RTF.

**20150225** + Too to translate timestamps into dates and vice versa.

**20150226** - Fucked this one up.

**20150227** + Got back on the horse. Implementation of random contraction algorithm
           for graphs.

**20150228** + Lexer for a simple lisp-like calculator language.

**20150301** + Parser for a simple lisp-like calculator language.

**20150302** - Fucked this one up.

**20150303** - LLVM compiler for a simple lisp-like calculator language.

**20150304** - Fucked this one up.

**20150305** - Fucked this one up.

**20150306** - Fibonacci function in LLVM IR.

**20150307** - Count adjectives in a text.

**20150308** - Simple genetic algorithm.

**20150309** - I am so tired.  I am **so** phoning it in today with a random exchange sort.

**20150310** - A python implementation of the infamous sleep sort.

**20150311** - Futile evening hacking on something that's not done yet. Prog explains failure.

**20150312** - Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

**20150313** - Completely blew this day.

**20150314** - An abbreviated "Hunt the Wumpus."

**20150315** - "Hunt the Wumpus" with superbats.

**20150316** - Partition a set of directed graphs.

**20150317** - Partition a set of undirected graphs. (Much simpler than 20150316.)

**20150318** - Simple use of readline function.

**20150319** - Another stupid sort using a genetic algorithm.

**20150320** - It's my birthday.  I basically wrote hello world in Haskell.  Now I'm going dancing.

**20150321** - Breadth-first search of a directed graph.

**20150322** - Depth-first search of a directed graph.

**20150323** - Simple flask app.

**20150324** - Permutations of a string.

**20150325** - A cruel guessing game.

**20150326** - Count to ten! (I spent all day working on another project.)

**20150327** - Calculate a square root.

**20150328** - Calculate pi the really old way.

**20150329** - Calculate e the really cool new way.

**20150330** - OSX objective-C UDP listener.

**20150331** - Quicksort in Prolog.

**20150401** - Tic-tac-toe with a stupid opponent.

**20150402** - Play sound file from Objective-C on OSX.

**20150403** - Dijkstra's shortest path first algorithm for potentially infinite graphs.

**20150404** - Poetry with indentation.  Boy was this an epic evening.

**20150405** - Silly endurance measure.  More or less matching my day.

**20150408** - Brain-dead. Non-functional javascript pagination.

**20150409** - Calculate pi by tossing pebbles into a circle.

**20150410** - 0/1 Knapsack problem.

**20150411** - Simple timeline with vis.js.
