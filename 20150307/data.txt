"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."

The second greatest trick may be the insurance industry's success in getting more than half the states to implement "tort reform." That achievement was based on the promise that restricting victims' ability to bring medical malpractice suits would improve healthcare and reduce its cost.  Those myths have now been completely dispelled.

The last bubble to burst was that because doctors are fearful of getting sued, they practice "defensive medicine," prescribing unnecessary and costly tests and procedures.  That myth was dispatched by the recent publication of a major study in the New England Journal of Medicine. A team of five doctors and public health experts found that tort reform measures passed in three states - specifically designed to insulate emergency room doctors from lawsuits - did nothing to reduce the number of expensive tests and procedures those ER doctors prescribed.
 
This latest study follows numerous others that deflated other tort reform myths: that making it harder for victims to file medical malpractice lawsuits would reduce the number of "frivolous" suits that "clog the courts;" that imposing caps on the damages victims could receive would reign in "out of control" juries that were awarding lottery-size sums to plaintiffs; and that malpractice insurance premiums would fall, thereby reversing a doctor shortage caused by specialists "fleeing the profession."
